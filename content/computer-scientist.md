Passionate about pursuing excellence no matter the field. Currently most interested in fields relating to data science, AI/ML, and cryptography. A math nerd at heart, I'm especially interested in the way computer science and mathematics intersect in such fields. I also find fulfillment in writing, be it technical or otherwise. Outside of tech, I seek to provide quality leadership, management, and organization.
